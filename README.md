# WorkTimely
*A cozy, functional focus and planning tool — where aesthetic journaling meets tech.*

## 🌿 Why I’m Building This
I manage my time okay, but I struggle to stay focused for long hours. And when it comes to planning?  
I’ve tried paper journals — but they get messy, disorganized, or forgotten.  
I’ve tried planner apps — but they’re either too rigid, too boring, or just too... robotic.

So I decided to build something that actually fits *my* energy.

This is a personal project that started with a simple stopwatch coded in Java. But I’m slowly evolving it into a Pomodoro timer + daily planner that looks and feels like using an aesthetic paper journal — but with helpful tech additions that make it actually *work*.

## ✅ What It Can Do (Right Now)
- ⏱️ Stopwatch with start, stop, and reset
- 💻 Simple, distraction-free Java Swing GUI
- 🎨 Fonts and layout that lean aesthetic (not plain old timers)

## 🌱 What’s Coming
- 🍅 Pomodoro mode to structure deep work sessions
- 🗓️ A planner to jot down daily tasks, to-dos, and goals
- 🧘 A design that feels warm and personal — not like a corporate dashboard
- 📓 (Optional) mood tracking, journaling, or reflection prompts

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Compile and run `Stopwatch.java`
3. Start tracking your time — and stay tuned for updates!

### 🛠️ About the Project
This is my little creative build — a project that’s growing with me.  
If you relate to the struggle of finding a planner that matches both your *mind* and your *mood*, feel free to follow the repo, suggest ideas, or even fork it to make your own version 💛
